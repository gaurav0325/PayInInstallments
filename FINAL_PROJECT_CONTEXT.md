## 📊 Business Logic & Rules

### **Model Categorization Logic**
- **Risk Assessment:** Who bears financial risk (BA, Partner, Bank, Shared)
- **Complexity:** Implementation difficulty (Low/Medium/High/Very High)
- **BA Revenue Impact:** When and how BA receives payment
- **Customer Experience:** User journey quality and branding
- **Technical Requirements:** 3DS, MIT, tokenization needs

### **Comparison Framework**
14 standardized aspects across all models:
1. **Model Type:** Core payment model category
2. **BA Gets Money:** Payment timing and source
3. **Risk:** Financial risk allocation
4. **Complexity:** Implementation difficulty
5. **Flexibility:** Customization capabilities
6. **Fees:** Cost structure and commissions
7. **Refund:** Refund processing approach
8. **Ledger & Accounting Adjustments:** Financial reconciliation
9. **CX (Customer Experience):** User journey quality
10. **Tokenisation and MIT:** Technical payment requirements
11. **MOR (Merchant of Record):** Transaction responsibility
12. **3DS/Fraud:** Authentication and security
13. **Additional Fees:** Extra charges and costs
14. **3RI Support:** 3-D Secure Requestor Initiated support

## 🎯 Recent Corrections Applied

### **Issue Resolution (2025-01-08)**
✅ **"Hold My Fare, Pay Later" Category Correction**
- **Issue:** Model was incorrectly placed in "Smart Routing Models"
- **Analysis:** Based on attributes (BA bears risk, no external financing), this is clearly a merchant-financed model
- **Solution:** Moved to "Deposit & Flexible Models" category where it logically belongs
- **Files Updated:** 
  - `app/page.tsx` - Updated model categorization
  - Badge changed from "New Model" to "Hold & Pay" for clarity

✅ **Comparison Table Synchronization**
- **Issue:** Table only showed 6 models while homepage displays 12
- **Analysis:** Missing 6 models created inconsistency between sections
- **Solution:** Added all missing models with comprehensive attributes:
  - Acquirer Driven
  - Deposit + Instalments 
  - Deferred Payment
  - Issuer Pre-purchase
  - Issuer Post-purchase
  - Hybrid Orchestrator
- **Files Updated:**
  - `components/EditableComparisonTable.tsx` - Added 6 new model entries
  - Each model includes all 14 comparison aspects with accurate business logic
