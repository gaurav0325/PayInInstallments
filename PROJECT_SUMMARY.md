### 🔗 API Endpoints

**Business Logic APIs:**
- `/api/eligibility` - Business rules validation engine
- `/api/plan-quote` - Payment plan calculations
- `/api/terms` - Model-specific terms and conditions

**Payment Simulation APIs:**
- `/api/authorise` - Payment authorization with 3DS triggers
- `/api/complete-3ds` - 3D Secure completion simulation

### 📊 Business Rules Engine

Each model implements specific eligibility criteria:
- **Market restrictions** (Spain-only for BNPL)
- **Amount thresholds** (€45 minimum, €1000 maximum for deferred)
